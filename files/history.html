                  They may be used to purchase special tracks, Avatars, and Items unavailable through regular game play. 
                  Spent Coins will not be refunded under any circumstances. 
                  Please note that Coin-related records are stored online, so a network connection is required for Coin use.

                  When logging on to another device, the previous device will be automatically removed. 
                  Thus, please refrain from sharing credentials, and keep your password strong, as the username is on leaderboard display.

                    <img src="./files/web/Info1.gif" class="w90 d_bl m_auto" /><br />
                    It gives you a brand new way to play the game by making sounds!<br />
                    Enjoy playing by clapping, drumming on the table or whatever ways to make sounds!<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ★How can I play Original Style?<br />
                    <img src="./files/web/Info2.png" class="w90 d_bl m_auto" /><br />
                    Tap the icon in the bottom right of the Mode (difficulty selection) screen, and switch from TAP STYLE to ORIGINAL STYLE!<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ★We recommend using earphones or external speakers!<br />
                    <img src="./files/web/Info3.png" class="w90 d_bl m_auto" /><br />
                    Using device's speaker may adversely affect responsiveness.<br />
                    We recommend using earphones or external speakers to improve accuracy of sound detection.<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ★Lower volume is recommended when using device's speaker.<br />
                    <br />
                    As the game registers any sounds made by device, we recommend lowering volume when using device's speaker.<br />
                    Here is our recommended volume adjustment:<br />
                    <br />
                    Smartphone series: 1/4 of maximum volume<br />
                    Tablet series: 1/2 of maximum volume<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ★Enjoy together!<br />

                    The game can be played by two or more people.<br />
                    Find out your own way and enjoy the game with your friends and family!
